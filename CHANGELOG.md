# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Admit tmux 3.3a through 3.8, including all intermediate stable releases,
  with `LibTmux.Version.requireSupported`. ([#2])

### Development

- Add a native capture backend for server metadata, sessions, windows, panes
  and attached clients. Detached observations preserve linked-window context;
  the capture API remains private. ([#2])
- Preserve non-text window labels, process names and paths. Validate complete
  captures and retain read ownership through cancellation and recovery. ([#2])
- Check tmux 3.3a and 3.8 in CI with the current Haskell toolchain, isolated
  servers and source-archive consumers. ([#2])
